        When you want to log an expense, shoot a text describing what you spent on, where, and how much, like:
        <blockquote><strong>Scott</strong>: <em>"I just went to this amazing modern art gallery in Amsterdam. The current exhibits on display were exquisite. And the entry to the gallery was only $18 for students!"</em></blockquote>
        TravelPal will automatically detect your expense category, location, cost, and more. You can also send out quick texts:
        <blockquote><strong>Scott</strong>: <em>"18 C Amsterdam"</em></blockquote>
        (Just text 'info' to get all of the category abbreviations!) Request real time status updates on how much you've spent by day, week, or month - or budget balances if you've provided a trip budget.
        <blockquote><strong>Scott</strong>: <em>"ds"</em></br>
        <strong>TravelPal</strong>:<em> "You have spent $56.00 today.""</em></br>
        <strong>Scott</strong>: <em>"wb"</em></br>
        <strong>TravelPal</strong>:<em>"You have $274.00 left in your weekly budget."</em></blockquote>
          Lastly, text in photos straight from your phone to your TravelPal to add it to your PhotoBlog!
